#
# Configuration file for pbuild.  This file is normally stored in ~/.pbuild,
# but can be customized with environment variable "PBUILD" (full path).
#

#
# Default log file location
# With no customization, you get:  "~/"  (expanded to your home directory)
#
# You can customize with lines like the following:
 
# logdir_prior: ~/pbuild_logs/prior
#
# If specified, logdir_prior forms a logfile directory that log files are
# moved to prior to pbuild starting up.  This allows you to save one level
# of prior log files from pbuild.
#
# Be certain to create the logfile directory prior to running pbuild

#
# Default selector to build if unspecified on command line.
#
# NOTE: This line must appear before all host entries to be handled properly!
#
# You can customize with a line like the following:
# select: om

select: om

#
# Systems to exclude in the build:
# With no customization, you get:  ""
#
# You can customize with a line like the following:
# exclude: sun_5.8_sparc,suse_9_32

#
# Settings that may be customized:
# With no cusomization, you get:
#   "CheckValidity,Debug,DeleteLogfiles,NoDiagnoseErrors,NoLogfileRename,NoLogfileSelect,Progress,SummaryScreen"
#
# You can customize with a line like the following:
#
# settings: LogfileRename

#
# Per-project configuration options:
#   Keyword:Project:value
#
# Valid keywords:  make_target, configure_options
# configure_options : nip : --dev

#
# Test settings that may be customized:
# Attributes are controlled with "test_attributes",
# Test names are controlled with "test_names".
#
# With no customization, you get all tests (no restrictions)
#
# You can customize with a line like the following:
#
# test_attributes: -slow
# test_names: atomic,condition

#
# This rest of the file contains lines with three pieces of information per
# line (space separated):
#   Optional: "Host:" constant to specify that this is a host entry
#   Key (name for referring to the entry)
#   Host name (DNS name or IP address)
#   Directory path on host
#   Project (must specify selector to specify project)
#      Project must be one of:
#         om (for Operations Manager),
#         oms (for Operatations Management Suite), or
#         a host of others (see documentation)
#   Optional: Select specification (to match with command line and/or default)
#      If a select entry is specified, you MUST specify a selector to build with
#      This is useful if you build multiple projects. If you only build one
#      project, then you need not specify the select specification.
